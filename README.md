Put the name of the message sender in QR banner (Request by /u/KingJordo [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/5lh37e/request_tweak_to_put_name_of_person_in_quick/?st=IXI6M2L2&sh=0cf31ee7).)

The current implementation will only show the name of the sender of the message.  A better approach would be to use the name that is shown in the Messages app for the conversation.  This is just a quicky simple take on it, pull requests are welcome!
